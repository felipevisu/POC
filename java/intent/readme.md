# Intent Pattern (Command Pattern)

The Intent pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.  
It separates the **invoker** (who triggers the action) from the **receiver** (who performs the action), promoting loose coupling and enabling sophisticated control flow.

### ‚úÖ Pros

* **Decoupling**: Separates the object that invokes the operation from the one that performs it.
* **Undo/Redo Support**: Built-in capability to reverse operations through the undo mechanism.
* **Macro Commands**: Can compose complex operations from simpler ones.
* **Queuing & Scheduling**: Intents can be stored, queued, and executed at different times.
* **Logging & Auditing**: Easy to track what operations were performed and when.
* **Parameterization**: Objects can be parameterized with different requests.

### ‚ùå Cons

* **Increased Complexity**: Introduces additional classes for each command type.
* **Memory Overhead**: Storing command history for undo operations consumes memory.
* **Potential Over-engineering**: May be overkill for simple, direct method calls.
* **State Management**: Complex commands may need to manage state for undo operations.

### üí° Common Use Cases

**Backend Systems**
* **API Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple microservice calls in a single business operation.
* **Transaction Management**: Implementing saga patterns with compensation logic.
* **Event Processing**: Converting domain events into executable commands.
* **Batch Processing**: Queuing and executing multiple operations in sequence.
* **Audit Trails**: Tracking all business operations for compliance and debugging.

**Enterprise Applications**
* **Workflow Engines**: Representing business process steps as executable intents.
* **Message Queue Processing**: Converting messages into actionable commands.
* **Database Migrations**: Implementing reversible schema changes.
* **Configuration Management**: Applying and rolling back system configuration changes.
* **ETL Pipelines**: Orchestrating data transformation steps with rollback capabilities.

**User Interfaces**
* **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Text editors, image editors, IDEs.
* **Button Actions**: Encapsulating complex UI operations behind simple button clicks.
* **Form Processing**: Converting form submissions into business operations.
* **Wizards & Multi-step Processes**: Managing complex user workflows.q
