# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.  
Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.  
This decouples the sender of a request from its potential receivers.

### ‚úÖ Pros

* Decouples request senders from receivers.
* Flexible: easy to add, remove, or reorder handlers.
* Promotes Single Responsibility Principle (each handler focuses on one concern).
* Supports dynamic runtime configuration of chains.

### ‚ùå Cons

* Harder to debug due to request traversal across multiple handlers.
* No guarantee a request will be handled (if the chain ends unhandled).
* Can lead to long chains with performance costs.
* Overhead for simple request flows.

### üí° Common Use Cases

**Backend Systems**
* Request/Response middleware pipelines (e.g., Express.js, Django middleware).
* Logging frameworks (different loggers in a chain: console, file, external service).
* Authentication & Authorization flows (token validation ‚Üí role checks ‚Üí permission checks).
* Event handling systems.

**Frontend / UI**
* UI event handling (click, keypress bubbling through handlers).
* Form validation (chained validation rules).
* Command handling in rich clients or editors.

**General**
* Customer support or workflow systems (escalation: support agent ‚Üí manager ‚Üí director).
* Approval processes (purchase order approval chain).
