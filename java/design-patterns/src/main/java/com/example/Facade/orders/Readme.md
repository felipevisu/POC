# Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code (subsystems).
It hides the complexity of subsystems and exposes a single unified API for the client.

### ‚úÖ Pros

* Simplifies the client‚Äôs interaction with complex subsystems.
* Reduces dependencies between client code and low-level services.
* Makes code easier to maintain and evolve by centralizing access points.
* Improves readability by exposing clear, high-level operations.

### ‚ùå Cons

* Can become a god object if it grows too large and starts handling too much logic.
* May hide important details from the client that are sometimes necessary.
* Overuse can lead to less flexible designs, if clients always go through the facade instead of occasionally needing direct access.

### üí° Common Use Cases

**Backend Systems**

* Order processing (payment, inventory, shipping ‚Üí exposed as one placeOrder() call).
* Authentication/authorization flows (token service, user service, audit logs).
* Service aggregators in microservices (unifying multiple APIs behind one gateway).

**Frontend / UI**

* Simplifying access to multiple APIs in a client SDK.
* Providing a single entry point for UI libraries or frameworks.
* Abstracting browser APIs into a cleaner interface for the app.
